## Publishing to PyPi (to make it pip installable)

NOTE - These instructions haven't been tested yet, this is placeholder text (written 2023-01-19)

You'll need to create a PyPi account and then create an API token for the Github Action configured in the file: `.github/workflows/publish_to_pypi_when_new_tag_is_pushed_to_main.yml` 

These instructions may help you set that up! https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/
